/*
 Simplified JavaScript is just the good stuff, including:

 - Functions as first class objects
 Functions in Simplified JavaScript are lambdas with lexical scoping.

 - Dynamic objects with prototypal inheritance
 Objects are class-free. We can add a new member to any object by ordinary
 assignment. An object can inherit members from another object.

 - Object literals and array literals
 This is a very convenient notation for creating new objects and arrays.
 JavaScript literals were the inspiration for the JSON data interchange format.
